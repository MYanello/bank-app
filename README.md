# bank-app

You are working with a bank that needs to manage its liquidity. Build a simple full stack application that:

- Pulls data on treasury yields
- Plots the yield curve back to the user
- Allows the user to submit an order for a specific term and amount
- Displays the userâ€™s historical order submissions
